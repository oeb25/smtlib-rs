## [0.3.0] - 2025-03-19

This release changes how terms are stored. In 0.2.0 terms where all stored with `'static`, making them `Copy` and easy to move around. The downside being that any constructed term would stick around _forever_. To mitigate this memory leak, while retaining `Copy` semantics 0.3.0 introduces the concept of `Storage`. Essentially this means that terms are allocated in a shared buffer, arena style. This swaps out `&'static` with `&'st`, meaning that all terms now carry around a lifetime of their storage binding them to live exactly as long as that, and allowing the storage to be dropped and memory reclaimed as needed. The downside is that now one needs lifetime allocation and to pass a storage. The first downside is inevitable if we want statically enforced lifetimes, but we've tried to mitigate the second by storing pointers to storage in convenient places, allowing for writing stuff like `x + 2` and having the resulting term be allocated seamlessly. An upside of using arena allocation, is that we open the possibility to interning terms, strings and slices plus arranging things more compactly in memory.

This update does contain quite a lot of breaking changes, but as a starting point for migration one we refer to [this commit](https://github.com/oembo-sse/slang/commit/194bb0f2106aa1854945f1dbc157e6ae9b26252a#diff-4ef84642e5c787de42f15b2c76f64c22bf07ffcd97f3b34ea8637035f7266caf) to give an idea of what's involved in updating.
